# Ecological Site Concepts, Descriptions, and Sections #

While the Ecological Site Concepts for MLRA 36 & 34, and to an extent 48A are fully developed, the Descriptions are at varying states of completion. ESD's vary widely in the content which they contain, some for example contain quantitative vegetation metrics, while the vasy majority do not. We assess the status of ESD's in their relation to our field office, and how they may affect the development of uniform benchmarks across the field office. 

The framework which we discuss these ESD's in will be relation to the modules which were developed in another, closely related document, '[UFO_]GraphModulesEsds'. These modules are meant to provide clusters for relating sites to each other, in the absence of quantitative metrics.
